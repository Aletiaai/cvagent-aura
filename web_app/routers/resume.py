# Purpose: Define API endpoints for resume processing (upload, triggering Drive processing, etc.). This replaces the interactive input() logic from your current main.py.
from fastapi import APIRouter, UploadFile, File, BackgroundTasks
# Import your agent's execution logic (we'll define this later)
# from agent.core.execution import trigger_resume_processing_from_file, trigger_resume_processing_from_drive

# Define UPLOAD_DIR here as well if needed, or import from a central config

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/trigger/drive/")
async def trigger_drive_processing(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks, drive_folder_path: str):
    # Trigger background processing for Drive
    # background_tasks.add_task(trigger_resume_processing_from_drive, drive_folder_path)
    return {"message": f"Processing triggered for Drive folder: {drive_folder_path}"}
    
# Add more endpoints as needed (e.g., get status, get results)


# Note: You'll need functions like trigger_resume_processing_from_file and trigger_resume_processing_from_drive in your agent/core/execution.py which this router will call. Using BackgroundTasks is crucial for long-running processes like LLM calls.
